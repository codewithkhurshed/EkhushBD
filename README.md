## An Effective E-Commerce System for Bangladesh to Adopt – An Empirical Study
**- Khorshed Alam, Mahbubul Haq Bhuiyan, Jawadur Rahman, Abul Hasan Fahim, Md. Ashik Miah** 

The e-commerce industry is booming in Bangladesh, and there is a growing demand for more advanced
features and functionalities that enhance user experience and increase sales. This paper presents an analysis
of some key ideas that are not currently available in the e-commerce platforms in Bangladesh. These ideas
include bidding on a product, augmented reality, virtual try-on,voice search and more. We discuss the
potential benefits of these ideas and their impact on the e-commerce industry in Bangladesh. We also
examine the challenges and limitations of implementing these features and propose some possible solutions.

## Software Specification Fixation Through Appropriate Steps
### Information Gathering
In this step, we did comprehensive domain study for our topic. In terms of gathering information, we’ve gone through Research Papers from Conferences and Journals, expert interviews, did market analysis, went through online websites etc.

For detailed overview of Information Gathering part, here’s the full documentation link:

### Analysis
For finding out the current status of E-Commerce domain in both Bangladesh and Foreign countries, we’ve done comprehensive studies on more than 10 existing E-Commerce platforms. By going through each of them, we find out their pros and cons and then compared our suggested model with their ones. The detailed manuscipt is attached below:

### Gap Analysis
By studying both local and foreign E-commerce market, and doing comprehensive domain study, we found out some of the gaps that current E-commerce market, more specifically local E-commerce platforms have. The findings are documented below:

●	E-commerce platforms in Bangladesh face challenges in securing funding for growth and expansion.
●	Establishing credibility and consumer trust is a significant hurdle.
●	Investment in warehousing and infrastructure is necessary for better product management and delivery.
●	Lack of trained human resources is a problem for managing e-commerce platforms on a large scale.
●	Inexperienced merchants and their issues with digital operations are a lagging point.
●	Proper marketing and partnerships are essential for successful promotion.
●	The scale of data management and security is a challenge for e-commerce platforms.
●	Lack of investment in data analysis can hinder business efficiency and accurate forecasting.

### Feature List Fixation
After proper domain study, we’ve fixed what our feature list will be for our proposed model. We’ve focused on only the value adding features for E-Commerce platform in our model, and accordingly, the functional requirements and non-functional requirements are documented in the next sub-sections.

## Non Functional Requirements

### Performance
a. The e-commerce web application should support up to 10,000 concurrent users. This implies that the system must be designed to handle a high number of simultaneous connections, ensuring a seamless user experience without any noticeable degradation in performance.
b. The average page load time should not exceed 2 seconds under normal load conditions. This includes time taken for server processing, data fetching, and rendering on the client side. To achieve this, the application should leverage caching, efficient database queries, and optimized front-end assets.
c. The response time for database queries should not exceed 100 milliseconds. This can be achieved through efficient database design, indexing, and query optimization.

### Scalability
a. The system should be capable of scaling horizontally to accommodate increased traffic. This means adding more instances of the application or services to handle the growing number of requests, without significant changes to the application architecture.
b. The system should automatically scale up/down based on traffic patterns using auto-scaling features provided by cloud infrastructure. This will involve monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) like CPU and memory usage and adjusting the number of instances accordingly to maintain optimal performance.

### Availability
a. The e-commerce web application should have an uptime of at least 99.9%. This translates to less than 9 hours of downtime per year. Achieving this level of availability requires a well-designed architecture, redundancy at all levels (such as using multiple availability zones), and robust monitoring and alerting systems.
b. The system should be fault-tolerant and resilient to hardware failures and network outages. This can be achieved by implementing redundancy, failover mechanisms, and distributed systems design principles to minimize the impact of any single point of failure.

### Security
a. The application should be compliant with industry-standard security practices, such as OWASP Top Ten (Open Web Application Security Protocol). This includes protection against common security threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.
b. All sensitive data, including user information and payment details, must be encrypted at rest and in transit. This can be achieved by using encryption algorithms like AES-256 for data at rest and SSL/TLS for data in transit.
c. Regular security audits should be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them accordingly. This includes penetration testing, code reviews, and infrastructure vulnerability scans.

### Maintainability
a. The codebase should follow best practices in terms of modularity, readability, and commenting. This includes following established coding standards, writing self-explanatory code, and adding comments for complex logic or non-obvious design decisions.
b. The system should be designed to allow for easy updates and feature additions without causing downtime. This can be achieved through modular architecture, feature toggles, and adherence to best practices for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

### Usability
a. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate. This includes providing clear visual hierarchy, consistent design patterns, and well-structured information architecture to guide users effortlessly through the application.
b. The application should be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring proper color contrast, and implementing keyboard navigation support, among other accessibility features.
